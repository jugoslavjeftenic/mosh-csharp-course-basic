00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.860
OK so this is the very first section of this course in this section I'm going to start by teaching you

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.380
the very basics of C-sharp.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.120
One of the questions that a lot of beginners ask is What is the difference between C-Sharp and dot net

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.520
.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.890
So that's the first thing I'm going to answer here.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.850
Next I'm going to talk about seal our or Common Language Runtime which is the runtime environment or

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.290
the applications.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.590
Next I'm going to talk about the architecture of Dot Net Applications and as part of this.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.920
I'm going to introduce you to concepts such as classes name spaces and assemblies.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.440
And finally I will show you all these concepts in action.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.740
I'm going to introduce you to the very basics of Visual Studio and write a very simple C Sharp application

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.930
so you can see classes name spaces and methods in action.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.050
I hope you enjoyed this section.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.710
And let's get started.
