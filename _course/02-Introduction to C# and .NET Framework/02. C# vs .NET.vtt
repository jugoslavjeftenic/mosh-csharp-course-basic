OK what is darknet framework and how is it different from C-Sharp some developers who are absolutely

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.700
new to C-Sharp don't know the difference.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.740
So in this lecture I'm going to talk a little bit about C-Sharp and what that framework Luescher is

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.270
a programming language.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.720
Dot Net is a framework for building applications under Windows Dartmouth's framework is not limited

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.960
to C-sharp.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.480
There are different languages that can target Dopping framework and build applications using that framework

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.860
.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.110
Examples are F sharp or VB dot net.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.740
Ok now what exactly is Dot Net Framework Dartmouth's framework consists of two components.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.670
One is called CLR or Common Language Runtime and the other is a class library for building applications

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.260
in the next lecture.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.320
We'll talk about C are in more detail
