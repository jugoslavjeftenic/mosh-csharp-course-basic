00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.900
OK so we got to comment.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.970
A comment is text that we put in our code to improve its readability and maintainability in C-sharp

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.530
we have two ways to write comments.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.870
If a comment is only a single line you can prefix a comment with double slash.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.240
But if your comment is longer and it's multiple lines you need to started with Slash start and then

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.060
finish it with Star slash.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.590
This type of comment is more like the comments we used to write in C and C++ code.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.660
These days it's more conventional to write either a single line or multi-line comments prefixing word

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.900
double slash.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.220
So in this example we can rewrite this multiline comment with double slash style like this.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.850
Now as a rule of thumb keep your comments to minimum use comments only when required and that's when

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.900
explaining whys hows constraint and things like that do not explain what the code is doing.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.360
Your code should be so clean and straightforward that it doesn't need comment.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.630
If a comment explains just what the code is doing is redundant and a problem with redundant comments

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.120
is we changed the code.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.860
But not everyone is very consistent in changing the comments.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.620
So after a while these comments become outdated and because they don't get compiled like the code there

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.180
is no way to validate them.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.960
And after a while they become useless.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.060
So again keep them to a minimum and explain why's hows and constraints that you had at the time you

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.830
wrote the code.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.430
So the next person who is reading your code knows the reason why you wrote the code.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.940
That's way
