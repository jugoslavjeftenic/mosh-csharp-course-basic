00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.500
In a section you learn that C-Sharp is esthetically type language which means once you declare a viable

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.820
you need to specify this type and that type cannot change during the lifetime of that variable.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.340
You also learn about the primitive types and C-Sharp such as integer character boolean and so on.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.750
Now when the next section.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.330
I'm going to introduce you to non primitive types in C Sharp social classes or a structure with arrays

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.000
strings and genomes.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.370
So I'll see the next section.
