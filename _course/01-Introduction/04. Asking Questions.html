<p>You may have questions throughout your course. Follow these steps to make the most of your course and become the best coder you can be.</p>



<p>1.     Do your own research. You can usually find the answer to your question by googling the question or the error you’re experiencing.</p>



<p>2.     Try to solve the problem without “phoning a friend”. Coming to the resolution on your own will help you grow and become a stronger coder.</p>



<p>3.     Still stuck? Post your question on the discussion board for the course. My team is here to help!</p>



<p>4.     Help other students by answering their questions on the discussion board. The best way to learn something is to teach it.</p>
